/**
 * spot.ts — the named-place primitive (cross-dimension).
 *
 * A Spot is a named point on the map, where condition sources hang: a
 * whitewater river section carries its home gauge (picked once per river,
 * then every session on that section freezes from the same gauge); a wind
 * launch or flying site carries the coordinates its wind/aloft snapshot is
 * fetched for. Session blocks denormalize the names they display, so a
 * renamed or deleted spot never rewrites history.
 *
 * Merged shape (2026-07-09 dimension merge): Water's typed river columns
 * PLUS Sky's free-string `kind` + `meta` bag. `kind` stays a free string —
 * 'river-section' and 'launch' (Water), 'flying-site' (Sky); new dimensions
 * add kinds without touching this type. Dimension-specific facts that don't
 * deserve a column live in `meta`, read through typed helpers that return
 * `undefined` when the fact was never recorded — absence is never fabricated
 * into false.
 */
